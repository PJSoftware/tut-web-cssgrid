# CSS Grid Tutorials

Let's follow a few CSS tutorials on Youtube!

### Responsive CSS Grid

As a CSS refresher, and a means of learning CSS Grid, I followed along with: [Build a Responsive Grid CSS Website Layout From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moBhzSC455o).

#### Lessons Learned:

* CSS Grid Layout
* Responsive design with @Media queries.
* `VSCode` shortcuts/code completion (Emmet) in HTML:
  * `![TAB]` to create bare HTML framework.
  * `.classname[TAB]` to create a div with a class.
  * `element.classname[TAB]` to create an element with a class.
* `VSCode` has a **Live Server** extension.

## DesignCourse

### "Broken Layout"

The full process of creating [a "Broken Layout" in HTML and CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOq6v-bmpYs); interpreting a static layout concept and making it fully responsive.

* SASS (and `VSCode`'s Live SASS Compiler.)
* "Mobile First" design

Ultimately, while this had some interesting information and ideas, I found the actual layout which was being implemented to be incredibly fiddly and ugly. There seemed to be a lot of markup which existed specifically for design elements, and the CSS file (compiled via the SCSS file, which is cool!) was very much specific to this one page. Really not applicable to likely other pages on the site.
